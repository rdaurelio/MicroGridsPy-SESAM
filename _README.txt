Cold Thermal Multi-Energy System Py (MES-Py)
========================

    ##### DESCRIPTION ##### 
The tool main objective is to provide an open-source alternative to the problem of sizing and dispatch of energy in multi-energy systems, integrating a cold thermal energy demand and electrical demand in rural application,
the model integrates reneawble sources with a backup system made of batteries and diesel generators to produce electricity and ice to be stored and dispatched.
Itâ€™s written in python(pyomo) and use excel and text files as input and output data handling and visualization. It is an expansion of the existing Micro-Grids Py library, developed by S.Balderrama and S.Quoilin.

Main features:

    Optimal sizing of: a) Lion-Ion batteries, diesel generators and renerable sources; 
                       b) Refrigerative cycle's compressor and thermal energy storage sizing to supply a single-node electricity demand and a cold thermal demand with the lowest cost possible.
    Optimal dispatch from different energy sources.
    Calculation of the net present cost of the system for the project lifetime.
    Determination of the LCOE for the optimal system.

    ##### RESULTS FILES #####

Results_Summary.xlsx : spreadsheet containing
			- sheet 'Size': Installed capacity of each component, including the TES size.
			- sheet 'Cost': Economic breakdown of the system. All the costs are ACTUALIZED to the year at which they occur.
			- sheet 'Yearly cash flows': Breakdown of yearly NON-ACTUALISED costs (fixed O&M, fuel cost, battery replacement, lost load), grouped by component type (battery, generators, renewable technologies)
			- sheet 'Yearly energy parameters': 
						* Generators share: total energy provided by generators divided by total electric demand
                                                * Renewables penetration: total energy provided by renewables divided by the sum of total energy provided by both renewables and generators
                                                * Curtailment share: total energy curtailed divided by the sum of total energy provided by both renewables and generators  
                                                * Battery usage: total energy discharged by the batteries divided by total electric demand
						* Grid usage: total energy withdrawn from the national grid divided by total electric demand
			- sheet 'Yearly energy parameters SC': 
						* Generators share: total energy provided by generators divided by total electric demand for each scenario.
                                                * Renewables penetration: total energy provided by renewables divided by the sum of total energy provided by both renewables and generators for each scenario.
                                                * Curtailment share: total energy curtailed divided by the sum of total energy provided by both renewables and generators for each scenario.
                                                * Battery usage: total energy discharged by the batteries divided by total electric demand for each scenario.
